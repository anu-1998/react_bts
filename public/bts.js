      BTS, also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a seven-member South Korean boy
      band that began formation in 2010 and debuted in 2013 under Big Hit
      Entertainment.[4] The septet—composed of Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V,
      and Jungkook—co-writes and co-produces much of their own output.
      Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to include a
      wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social
      commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age
      youth and coming-of-age, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and
      individualism. Their work features references to literature and
      psychological concepts and includes an alternative universe storyline. The
      group has released several albums and performed on several world tours.
